# EggPool Active Planning Registry

This file is the compact control surface for active interim planning.
Detailed requirements and completed history remain in source roadmaps,
implementation plans, `plans/closure/`, flat legacy plans, and Git history.
Links only — do not duplicate milestone requirements here.

Canonical direction:

- `plans/000-long-term-specification.md`
- `plans/001-terminology-and-domain-model.md`
- `plans/002-long-term-roadmap.md`
- `plans/003-planning-process.md`

Legacy archive (pre-251, immutable, top level): `plans/001-*` through
`plans/250-*` plus `python_hotpath_dispatch_compression_optimization.md`.
Most recently closed: Request admission and wire M005 (planning reconciliation
and minor wire cleanup, `plans/closure/request-admission-wire/005-status.md`). Legacy
archive latest: Plan 250 (EggServe 0.3.0 direct-Tower migration,
`7879cbf9`). Plans 244–245, 215–220, 241 remain historical per their own
closure passes; the `146-*` duplicate pair is a known numbering accident.

## Status vocabulary

- **proposed** — roadmap or plan exists but is not approved for execution.
- **ready** — dependencies and interfaces satisfied; may be handed off.
- **active** — implementation or closure work in progress.
- **blocked** — a named dependency or evidence requirement prevents progress.
- **closing** — implementation landed; closure evidence being gathered.
- **closed** — closure record accepted.
- **conditionally closed** — substantial work landed, named correctness or
  operational evidence remains (condition + risk + exact future evidence in
  the closure record).
- **superseded** — replaced by another document.
- **archived** — no longer active; retained for traceability.

## Active subsystem roadmaps

| Subsystem | Status | Roadmap | Current milestone | Dependencies or blockers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Provider transport | active | `plans/subsystems/provider-transport-roadmap.md` | M002 blocked — stable Eggfetch transport error taxonomy | Requires a published upstream typed classification interface. |
| Routing selection | active | `plans/subsystems/routing-selection-roadmap.md` | M001 closed — ordered quota-scoring and candidate-allocation cleanup | M002 stays evidence-gated (no affinity workload measured yet). |
| Persistence | active | `plans/subsystems/persistence-roadmap.md` | M001 conditionally closed, M002 closed; M003 conditional | M001 production landed; physical Pi/MMC evidence outstanding per `plans/closure/persistence/001-status.md` §11. M003 stays not started behind that condition. |

## Dependency-ready implementation plans

| Subsystem | Milestone | Status | Implementation plan | Dependencies / handoff note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Persistence | M001 bounded passive checkpoint scheduling and target qualification | conditionally closed | `plans/implementation/persistence/001-bounded-passive-checkpoint-scheduling-and-qualification.md` | Production mechanism landed (`6eae94db`); physical Pi/MMC evidence required for full closure. |
| Persistence | M002 single-gate tenure and metrics-flush allocation cleanup | closed | `plans/implementation/persistence/002-single-gate-tenure-and-metrics-flush-allocation-cleanup.md` | Structural gate-tenure cleanup with row/rebuffer equivalence (`52494140`). |
| Routing selection | M001 ordered quota-scoring and candidate-allocation cleanup | closed | `plans/implementation/routing-selection/001-ordered-quota-scoring-and-candidate-allocation-cleanup.md` | Deferred Plan 231 transient cleanup with seam parity (`4db8000d`); M002 stays evidence-gated. |

## Blocked work

| Subsystem | Milestone | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Provider transport | M002 stable Eggfetch transport error taxonomy | Upstream Eggfetch does not yet expose/publish a general-purpose typed classification surface sufficient to replace the remaining Hyper/Rustls source-chain inspection; requires separate upstream planning. |

## Unblock audit

Provider-transport M001, M003, and M004 are closed. M004 did not depend on
M002 and did not change its upstream API blocker.
Provider-transport M002 remains blocked on an upstream Eggfetch typed
classification interface and is not promoted to an implementation plan.
Request-admission-wire M001 is closed after consuming the stable
server-transport interface. Explicit user direction reopened that subsystem for
the wire-kernel extraction sequence: M002 is closed (`ca3d16b3` seam +
`wire_extraction_contract`/`wire_kernel_boundary` corpus); M003 is closed
(`5f373c98` crate + cutover); M004 is closed (`72d6d442` fidelity/provenance/
conformance, additive only). Explicit user direction opens M005 as a bounded
corrective/polish pass for planning reconciliation plus the two low-severity
cleanup findings recorded by M004. M005 is closed (`4a1315a1` shared classifier
+ `Approximated` reservation + planning reconciliation, 781 default / 782
no-default tests green, no medium-or-higher finding); the
request-admission-wire subsystem is closed with no ready successor. No
provider-transport blocked work is promoted; Provider
M002 remains blocked on upstream Eggfetch API work.


Explicit user direction opens the persistence performance workstream at the current Rust baseline. Persistence M001 is dependency-ready against the completed Plan 239 diagnostic and Plan 240 design constraints; its physical SBC requirement is operational closure evidence, not a reason to invent a different storage architecture. Provider-transport M002 remains blocked and is unaffected.

Persistence M001 is conditionally closed (`6eae94db` implementation, `plans/closure/persistence/001-status.md`): the bounded passive-checkpoint mechanism, tuning hooks, report plumbing, and host verification are landed; the physical Pi/MMC Work package C gate is the named condition for full closure.

Persistence M002 is closed (`52494140` implementation, `plans/closure/persistence/002-status.md`): gate-tenure and metrics-flush ownership cleanup with row/rebuffer equivalence.

Routing-selection M001 is closed (`4db8000d` implementation, `plans/closure/routing-selection/001-status.md`): ordered quota-scoring and candidate-allocation cleanup with seam parity and twin-router determinism.

Unblock audit (all three closures): persistence M003 stays not started behind M001's physical-evidence condition (it requires full target evidence to decide periodic-sufficient vs event-driven); routing-selection M002 stays not started — M001's closure satisfies its hard dependency, but its evidence dependency (representative 64/512/4096-entry affinity workload) was not produced here, so no implementation plan is authorized yet; provider-transport M002 remains blocked on upstream Eggfetch API work. No other eligible plans exist.
