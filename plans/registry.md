# EggPool Active Planning Registry

This file is the compact control surface for active interim planning.
Detailed requirements and completed history remain in source roadmaps,
implementation plans, `plans/closure/`, flat legacy plans, and Git history.
Links only — do not duplicate milestone requirements here.

Canonical direction:

- `plans/000-long-term-specification.md`
- `plans/001-terminology-and-domain-model.md`
- `plans/002-long-term-roadmap.md`
- `plans/003-planning-process.md`

Legacy archive (pre-251, immutable, top level): `plans/001-*` through
`plans/250-*` plus `python_hotpath_dispatch_compression_optimization.md`.
Most recently closed: Persistence M004 (physical checkpoint qualification
and final disposition, periodic strategy rejected on the target class,
`plans/closure/persistence/004-status.md`). Legacy archive latest: Plan 250
(EggServe 0.3.0 direct-Tower migration, `7879cbf9`). Plans 244–245, 215–220,
241 remain historical per their own closure passes; the `146-*` duplicate
pair is a known numbering accident.

## Status vocabulary

- **proposed** — roadmap or plan exists but is not approved for execution.
- **ready** — dependencies and interfaces satisfied; may be handed off.
- **active** — implementation or closure work in progress.
- **blocked** — a named dependency or evidence requirement prevents progress.
- **closing** — implementation landed; closure evidence being gathered.
- **closed** — closure record accepted.
- **conditionally closed** — substantial work landed, named correctness or
  operational evidence remains (condition + risk + exact future evidence in
  the closure record).
- **superseded** — replaced by another document.
- **archived** — no longer active; retained for traceability.

## Active subsystem roadmaps

| Subsystem | Status | Roadmap | Current milestone | Dependencies or blockers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Provider transport | active | `plans/subsystems/provider-transport-roadmap.md` | M002 blocked — stable Eggfetch transport error taxonomy | Requires a published upstream typed classification interface. |
| Routing selection | active | `plans/subsystems/routing-selection-roadmap.md` | M001 closed — ordered quota-scoring and candidate-allocation cleanup | M002 stays evidence-gated (no affinity workload measured yet). |
| Persistence | active | `plans/subsystems/persistence-roadmap.md` | M005 ready — M004 evidence/planning reconciliation corrective pass | M004 rejection outcome stands, but cumulative-vs-delta narration and M003 lifecycle/numbering require reconciliation before any event-driven handoff. |

## Dependency-ready implementation plans

| Subsystem | Milestone | Status | Implementation plan | Dependencies / handoff note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Persistence | M005 M004 evidence and planning reconciliation corrective pass | ready | `plans/implementation/persistence/005-m004-evidence-and-planning-reconciliation-corrective-pass.md` | Documentation/evidence-only corrective pass; committed M004 artifacts are the source of truth; zero production Rust diff required. |

## Blocked work

| Subsystem | Milestone | Blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Provider transport | M002 stable Eggfetch transport error taxonomy | Upstream Eggfetch does not yet expose/publish a general-purpose typed classification surface sufficient to replace the remaining Hyper/Rustls source-chain inspection; requires separate upstream planning. |

## Recently closed

## Unblock audit

Provider-transport M001, M003, and M004 are closed. M004 did not depend on
M002 and did not change its upstream API blocker.
Provider-transport M002 remains blocked on an upstream Eggfetch typed
classification interface and is not promoted to an implementation plan.
Request-admission-wire M001 is closed after consuming the stable
server-transport interface. Explicit user direction reopened that subsystem for
the wire-kernel extraction sequence: M002 is closed (`ca3d16b3` seam +
`wire_extraction_contract`/`wire_kernel_boundary` corpus); M003 is closed
(`5f373c98` crate + cutover); M004 is closed (`72d6d442` fidelity/provenance/
conformance, additive only). Explicit user direction opens M005 as a bounded
corrective/polish pass for planning reconciliation plus the two low-severity
cleanup findings recorded by M004. M005 is closed (`4a1315a1` shared classifier
+ `Approximated` reservation + planning reconciliation, 781 default / 782
no-default tests green, no medium-or-higher finding); the
request-admission-wire subsystem is closed with no ready successor. No
provider-transport blocked work is promoted; Provider
M002 remains blocked on upstream Eggfetch API work.


Explicit user direction opens the persistence performance workstream at the current Rust baseline. Persistence M001 is dependency-ready against the completed Plan 239 diagnostic and Plan 240 design constraints; its physical SBC requirement is operational closure evidence, not a reason to invent a different storage architecture. Provider-transport M002 remains blocked and is unaffected.

Persistence M001 is conditionally closed (`6eae94db` implementation, `plans/closure/persistence/001-status.md`): the bounded passive-checkpoint mechanism, tuning hooks, report plumbing, and host verification are landed. The M004 closure now resolves the physical-evidence condition with a rejection verdict; the M001 mechanism is retained as additive-safe and its performance claim is unfulfilled.

Persistence M002 is closed (`52494140` implementation, `plans/closure/persistence/002-status.md`): gate-tenure and metrics-flush ownership cleanup with row/rebuffer equivalence.

Routing-selection M001 is closed (`4db8000d` implementation, `plans/closure/routing-selection/001-status.md`): ordered quota-scoring and candidate-allocation cleanup with seam parity and twin-router determinism.

Persistence M004 (`8113d264` zero-Rust-diff closure, `plans/closure/persistence/004-status.md`) collected thirteen accepted Pi 5 / ext4 / MMC physical runs at `artifacts/qualification/m004/` against the production M001 mechanism. The 60s/256 candidate maxima were 1709 / 561 / 10 943 ms; bounded matrix candidates (60s/128, 60s/64, 30s/64) and the minimum-cadence 1s/64 stress run all left the foreground tail. Three ordinary `--benchmark-samples 10` runs converged (`pending_requests=0`, `active_reservations=0`, peak RSS ≈ 18.2 MB) with backup / recovery / restart / shutdown / rehash / bounded-maintenance / graceful-shutdown all green. Periodic strategy is rejected on the target class; landed 60s/256 constants untouched per plan §6.2.

Unblock audit (M004 closed): persistence M003 is promoted from `not started` to `ready` because the M004 evidence satisfies its hard dependency ("M001 closure evidence must explicitly show the periodic strategy is insufficient"). M003 still requires its own implementation plan with the architecture review gate the persistence roadmap §7 prescribes (no per-request task spawning, no second SQLite connection, no public checkpoint configuration, lifecycle/cancellation/shutdown/WAL bounds/single-worker ownership before code changes). No implementation plan is created by this closure. Routing-selection M002 stays not started — its 64/512/4096-entry affinity workload is still not produced and is outside M004 scope. Provider-transport M002 remains blocked on the upstream Eggfetch typed classification interface. No blocked work is promoted to a dependency-ready implementation plan by this commit.


Persistence M005 is registered as the corrective layer for M004's evidence
interpretation and planning-lifecycle defects. The M004 periodic-strategy
rejection remains the working architectural disposition, but no M003 runtime
handoff is authorized until M005 closes. M005 must preserve the immutable M004
closure, machine-check the committed artifact deltas, correct current docs, and
reserve local implementation-plan number 003 for the future event-driven
checkpoint milestone.
