# Development Workflow

## Current runtime

Run from the repository root:

```bash
cargo fmt --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml -- --check
cargo clippy --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- --test-threads=1
cargo build --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --locked
```

Strict Clippy is a repository invariant across all Rust targets. Do not add a
baseline allowlist or broad suppression; resolve new warnings locally and use
narrow, justified allowances only when the intentional API or test shape is
clearer and safer.

## Tooling

Python is retained for release/validation scripts and their tests only:

```bash
uv sync --dev
uv run ruff format --check scripts/ tests/tooling/
uv run ruff check scripts/ tests/tooling/
uv run pyright scripts/
uv run pytest tests/tooling/ -q --tb=short --maxfail=1
```

Focused release checks include the catalog, package boundary, release
workflow, retirement boundary, and quick-installer qualification validators.
Do not add a Python application fallback or import the retired application.
