# Architecture Principles

## Core Principles

- Package boundaries must remain explicit
- Request proxying, routing, accounting, and dashboard concerns must not be combined in endpoint handlers
- Use Pydantic v2 for all data validation
- Use aiosqlite for all database operations

## Request Lifecycle

- All data-plane requests flow through `RequestCoordinator`
- Requests must be persisted before upstream dispatch
- Pre-body failures can retry; no retry after first downstream byte emitted
- Every retryable failed attempt must reach terminal state before the next attempt
- Each attempt reservation is released exactly once via AttemptFinalizer

## Database Invariants

- SQLite is the durable source of truth for quota windows (5h/7d/30d)
- SQLite transactions are serialized across concurrent tasks via a single connection lock + ContextVar
- All SQL operations on the shared connection are serialized; no task can execute SQL inside another task's transaction
- Every DML write must run inside `async with db.transaction():`; write helpers refuse to operate outside an owned transaction
- `Database.vacuum()` is the only sanctioned path for `VACUUM` in production code

## Concurrency

- Readiness probes use `probe_writable()` with owned transactions, never interfere with request lifecycle work
- Child tasks cannot inherit transaction ownership (both task identity and ContextVar depth must match)
- Reservation and active-count in-memory cleanup occur only when the database reservation actually transitions
- Exhausted retries cannot corrupt another request's in-memory state

## Quota and Routing

- Successful responses without terminal usage consume the reservation estimate
- Unknown model protocols are rejected before durable selection
- Quota-exhausted accounts recover after cooldown expiration via `_refresh_transient_state()`
- Pending active requests are excluded from expiry cleanup
- Cancelled nonzero-cost requests remain in usage windows
- Cache-only rate changes create snapshots; cache-only token usage invokes cost calculation

## Health and Failure Classification

- Health systems use a normalized `FailureCategory` vocabulary shared by `HealthManager` and `AccountRuntimeState`
- `models.resolution_status` is set to `'resolved'` for all persisted models with resolved protocols

## Security

- Local client credentials (`Authorization`, `X-Api-Key`, `Proxy-Authorization`) are stripped before upstream forwarding
- Only the selected account's bearer token is injected
- Persisted `error_detail` is fail-closed by default; the strengthened redactor (regex + JSON sanitization) only runs when `security.persist_redacted_error_detail = true`
- Optional persisted `error_detail` uses a strict diagnostic allowlist (`SAFE_JSON_KEYS`); arbitrary provider payload keys are dropped
- Never store API keys in SQLite
- Never log prompts, completions, or API keys
- Use constant-time comparison for API key verification

## Deployment

- The systemd unit intentionally omits `ExecReload`; all configuration changes require `sudo systemctl restart gorouter`
- The `scripts/check_database.py` checker opens the database read-only via `file:...?mode=ro` and refuses to mutate anything
- The `scripts/check_database.py` checker is fail-closed: it treats missing `_migrations`, empty `_migrations`, missing required tables/columns, and query errors as exit code 2 (configuration/schema error), not zero violations
- The `scripts/smoke_test.py` stream diagnostics use a rolling tail buffer to recognize SSE markers split across arbitrary transport chunks
- `scripts/verify_upstream_auth.py` is operator-only: it bypasses GoRouter to confirm the configured key works directly upstream
- Pyright in CI covers `src/` AND `scripts/`; narrow type annotations with `cast` or `Any` rather than excluding a file

## Testing

- `tests/integration/test_phase17_deployment_readiness_matrix.py` is the cross-cutting release-gate for the matrix in the Phase 17 plan
- `tests/integration/test_phase18_cleanup.py` is the cross-cutting release-gate for the Phase 18 final-cleanup matrix
- The historical schema fixture at `tests/fixtures/schema/pre_phase17_v11.sql` is the authoritative upgrade-compatibility baseline; its SHA-256 is recorded in `tests/fixtures/schema/checksums.json` and any edit fails the checksum test

## CLI Commands

- `models refresh` synchronizes configured accounts via `AccountRepository.sync_from_config` before refreshing the catalog, so cached account/model relationships match normal application startup
